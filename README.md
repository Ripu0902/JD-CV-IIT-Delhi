# AI-Powered JD-CV Matching System  

🚀 **Revolutionizing Recruitment with AI**  

## 📌 Overview  
This project is an **AI-powered Job Description (JD) & CV Matching System** designed to enhance recruitment efficiency using **prompt engineering and NLP**. It leverages **LLM-based resume ranking** to improve hiring accuracy, reduce bias, and optimize candidate selection.  

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
Traditional hiring methods rely on keyword-based filtering, leading to:  
- ❌ **Inefficient Matching** – Missing contextual relevance in resumes.  
- ⏳ **Slow Processes** – Increased time-to-fill job positions.  
- ⚖️ **Bias Issues** – Unconscious biases impacting fair hiring.  

## 🛠️ Solution Approach  
This system uses **LLMs with prompt engineering** to intelligently rank resumes based on **skills, experience, and job relevance**.  

### 🔑 Key Features  
✅ **AI-Powered Resume Ranking** – Matches JDs with resumes based on structured LLM prompts.  
✅ **Bias Mitigation** – Anonymized screening for fair candidate selection.  
✅ **Skill-Based Matching** – Identifies exact and prerequisite skills.  
✅ **Explainable AI** – Provides reasoning for candidate ranking.  

## 🔍 How It Works  
1. **JD & CV Upload** – Recruiters submit job descriptions; candidates upload resumes.  
2. **Data Extraction** – OCR and text processing from PDFs, DOCs, and images.  
3. **Prompt-Based Ranking** – LLM ranks resumes based on a structured prompt framework.  
4. **Scoring & Evaluation** – Hybrid ranking using **LLM-based reasoning and predefined weights**.  
5. **Results & Explanation** – AI generates ranked candidate lists with justifications.  

## 🏗️ Tech Stack  
- **NLP Models**: OpenAI GPT models (for semantic analysis and ranking).  
- **Data Extraction**: `pdfplumber`, `python-docx`, `pytesseract` (OCR for image-based resumes).  
- **Backend**: Flask (REST API).  
- **Frontend**: React.js (for UI).  
- **Database**: MongoDB (for structured resume storage).  
- **Vector Search**: FAISS (for future retrieval-based ranking improvements).  

## 🔥 Unique Selling Points  
- **Intelligent Resume Ranking** with **LLM-powered prompt engineering**.  
- **Hybrid Matching** – Combines AI scoring and manual tuning.  
- **Bias Reduction** – Fair hiring practices through anonymized evaluation.  
- **Seamless ATS Integration** – API-based connectivity with existing hiring systems.  

## 🚀 Future Scope  
📌 **Enhancing LLM-based ranking with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.  
📌 **Expanding multi-language support for global recruitment**.  
📌 **Integrating with major Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)**.  
📌 **Soft skills and behavioral analysis using AI models**.
